			<h1>My Name is: Jason Strang</h1>

	<p>
			Here is a little information about me:<br>
			I worked my way up to Executive Chef in the Hospitality Industry for 18 years.
			During the pandemic, life took a twist and I decided to go get my second degree
			in Computer Technology, more specifically Programming. I am not sure where this
			will take me but its pretty fun. I enjoy playing video games, which is why I 
			chose to do this, sports, family time, visiting the world. I grew up in 
			Charleston so its awesome to see how its grown in the tech field and I can't 
			wait to be be apart of it!
